## Project Overview

> Our project aims to optimize the global transportation and shipment of goods by leveraging PSA's node-to-network effect. By integrating data from various PSA locations, we seek to minimize both financial costs and environmental impacts, such as carbon footprint, while maximizing the efficiency of logistics operations. Through advanced analysis of routes and transportation modes, the project will provide data-driven solutions to improve decision-making and reduce the overall environmental and economic burdens of global trade.
